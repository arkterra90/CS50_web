Lecture 6 User Interfaces:
-Single-Page Applications
    -Using Jave a web application can be a single page.
    -Rapid page loading due to only modifying the DOM and not loading an entire new page.
Django:
    -We can create views that send json as responses to make api calls.
    -Json can fetch from our web server what we would like to display in our DOM tree.
    -We can use console.log to view things much like return with python.
    -Java uses a query to get the info called AJAX
    -An advanate in efficieny
    -We loss being able to tell by the url what page we are on.
        -We can manipulate the url with history.pushState to add a new element to a users browsing
        history.
        -Window.onpopstate can take an event as an arguement to go back to a users state to show
        the correct state stored in the users history.
    -java window 
        -window is what the user actually sees
        -window.innerWidth knowing how wide the window is
        -window.innerHeight how high.
        -window.scrollY how many pixels down you have scrolled
            -the entire page height is represented by document.body.offsetHeight
        -Using these we might want to know if a user has scrolled to the bottom of the page.
            -scrollY + innerHeight has to equal offsetHeight
            -Could be useful on a website that has infinte scroll like a social media site
            then AJAX call for additional calls for information
Animation:
    -The ability to make something move around and animate. IE change size, color, or position
