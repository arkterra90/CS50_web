Week5 Javascript Notes:
    Javascript:
        Why is it helpful?
            Client and server. Client sends  request to server.
            All the code we have written runs on a server. Java enables us to write client side code in the users web browser.
            Allows us to make webpages more interactive by manipulating the DOM.
            HTML only describes the page based on tags and nested tags.
        Adding Java to HTML 
            Use <script> </script> tags to let the browser know there is a script to run.
        Java helps with event driven programming.
            things like a user clicks on a button and drop down list.
            Java allows us to add event listeners.
        Toggling something back a forth
            We can use conditions like if else
        If we have a variable that is not going to change label it "const"
        Javascript console
            normally in inspector
        Jave can be moved to it's own file by using <script src="file path"> in the initial Java tag.
            Allows use of code accross multiple pages.
