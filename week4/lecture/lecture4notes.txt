SQL, Models, and Migrations

Django allows us to have an abstraction layer to interact with SQL.
Data:
    Storing data in a relational database allows us to interact with data in our application.
    SQL allows us to have a database languege to manage relational databases.
    MySQL & PostgeSQL are for big data management
    SQLite is more for servers and liter weight implementation that MySQL, stores all data in a single file.
        Many of the same syntax for SQLite applies to other SQL 
    SQL
        Has Data types like all programing languages.
            SQLite - Text, numeric, integer(ints & NUMBERS WITH DECIMAL POINTS), real(), 
                BLOB(binary large object, audio files and images.)
            MySQL - has a longer list of storeable data types that can add some efficiencys
                CHARSET, VARCHAR, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE
    Creating a table:
        CREATE TABLE flights (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            origin TEXT NOT NULL,
            destination TEXT NOT NULL,
            duration INTEGER NOT NULL
        );
        each lower case item is a column title,
        the upper case is the type of data being stored.
        NOT NULL is an example of an additional constraint on the data.
