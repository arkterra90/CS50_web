Week7 CI/CD:
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deilivery
-Testing:
    -A way to verify the code is being deployed correct. As it grows more complicated to verify it still
    behaves the way it is needed to.
    -Assert states that something should be true. If not true it throws an error. In python3
    -When ecountering a bug in the program we would want to fix the bug and write a test to make sure
    the bug doesn't persist in future changes. 
    -Assures future feature changes don't break older features.
    -Test can be written with each new feature add to make sure new features don't break old features.
-Scripts:
    -We can write a script to test a function to produce an output we would expect.
-unittest
    -A library to write test and automate the testing process
    -assertEqual
    -assertNotEqual
    -assertTrue
    -assertFalse
    -assertIn
    -assertNotIn
-Django Test.py 
    -Go to python3 manage.py test
    -Checking for webpages in django
-Selenium browser testing
-Continuous Integration/Continuous Deilivery
    -CI 
        -Frequent merges to main branch
        -Automated unit testing
            -Verifies each little part can work as expected
    -CD 
        -Short release schedules
        -If something goes wrong you know immediately
        -Allows new features to quickly go to users. helps in a competitive market
    -GitHub Actions
        -Allows the creation of a work flow to check steps of deployment
        -Can check coding style, run test, and verify functionality of code.
        -YAML a file format used by Actions 
            -key1: value1
